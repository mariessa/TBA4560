\chapter{Introduction}


In this ever-changing world we are more dependant on up-to-date geospatial data, and without frequent updating of map data the service databases can fast become out-of-date. Traditionally the management system of the basic map data (FKB) in Norway was a local production at the municipalities, where the updated map data was sent to the central data store once or twice a year. When occasions for updating are rare this may cause great data quality problems \citep{Lehto2015, Peng2005}. 

For about ten years the Norwegian cadastre, \textit{Matrikkelen}, has had a well functioning centralised production system \cite{Falkanger2017} - will this work for other geospatial systems in Norway as well? 
%Traditionally the management system of the basic map data in Norway was a local production at the municipalities - where the updated map data was sent to the central data store once or twice a year - but 
Today the new implementation of the the management system of the FKB map data in Norway follows a system where the municipalities directly update the map data to the data store managed by the Norwegian Mapping Authority, \textit{Kartverket}. Are there only advantages to this change, or are there some challenges by updating geospatial data directly in to a central data base?
In this paper we will try to answer this question, and the main objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To give a state of the art description of the cadastre and basic map data systems in Norway.
\item To give an overview of techniques for transferring geospatial information, and see whether they are platform independent or not.
\item To discuss the pros and cons of having a centralised management system of geosaptial data.
\end{enumerate}



The paper is structured as follows: Initially there are two theoretical chapters presenting the two main registers of geospatial information in Norway and the techniques for updating and synchronise to and from those. 
%This is followed by a brief presentation of the managing systems in the neighbouring countries Sweden and Denmark. 
The following chapters discuss the benefits and disadvantages of updating data into a central data store, and includes as well a brief discussion on generic versus platform dependent API's. We close the paper with a conclusion on whether there are some disadvantages to centralising the updating and management of the basic map data.

%All objectives shall be stated such that we, after having read the thesis, can see whether or not you have met the objective. ``To become familiar with \ldots'' is therefore not a suitable objective.
%The rest of the report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 gives an introduction to \ldots
%and will be further described in chapter \ref{ngis} kan brukes til senere
%As stated in Chapter \ref{SFKB}
