\section*{Preface}

%Here, you give a brief introduction to your work. What it is (e.g., a Project thesis in geotechnics at NTNU as part of the MSc in Civil and Environmental Engineering or Geotechnics and Geohazards), when it was carried out (e.g., during the autumn semester of 2013). If the project has been carried out for a company, you should mention this and also describe the cooperation with the company. You may also describe how the idea to the project was brought up.\\[2cm]

This project assignment is written for the division of Geomatics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). It is part of the MSc in Engineering and ICT, and was written in the autumn of 2017. 

I would like to thank my advisers Lars Eggan (Norconsult Informasjonssystemer) and Terje Midtbø (NTNU) for all the help I have been given.
