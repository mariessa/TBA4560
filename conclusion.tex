%"A third key business objective was to address the increasing customer demands for improved application availability, not only in terms of failure recovery, but for the more important reduction of planned outage times. Today, there is less opportunity for planned systems shutdowns in the global economic environment. Here again, meeting this objective was key to the Parallel Sysplex cluster design." \cite{Nick1997}

To mitigate the problems caused, Walby said server virtualisation was being explored by many firms, and storage virtualisation was also being taken more seriously." \cite{Tash2006}


%\cite{doi:10.1080/17538947.2017.1351583}   A paradigm-shift is needed, not only on the side of data providers, but also on the side of users who use large volumes of geospatial data. Data users have to shift from the traditional geospatial data workflow where large volumes of data have been downloaded and replicated onto local machines towards a workflow with integrated web service standards for data access and processing, that does not require time-consuming data download anymore. Data providers have to be more progressive towards offering server-based data access and processing in a standardised and interoperable way.


%Because GML, SVG, WFS, and WMS are all international industry standards, the greatest strength of the proposed framework lies in the promised syntactic interoperability. \cite{YaoXiaobai2008Iimo}


%As this paper has presented there are a few drawbacks of updating directly to a central data store. On the other hand, the benefits seem to be greater, and thus the SFKB-system have a bright future ahead; providing a greater national collaboration of the basic map data, where the end-users may rest assured of fresh data of high quality.

The process of storing map data locally and later send those data to \textit{Kartverket} was perhaps unnecessarily time-consuming and inefficient. But, as this paper has presented, there are a few drawbacks of updating directly to a central data store as well. The time it takes to transfer a change to a central system may have latencies. Solutions of this issue for the SFKB system are zipping of files for downscaling the load, and short transactions providing short sessions, thus preventing latency.
On the other hand, the benefits seem to be greater than the disadvantage - the SFKB-system seems to have a bright future ahead. It will reduce operational cost by lessening the import, export, copying and control costs of the data, as \cite{Kartverket2017e} sums it up.  This is in addition to improving service delivery for the public, providing it with fundamental and reliable map data, freshly updated at all times.
