abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this paper, we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTPattern recognition in road networks can be used for different applications, including spatiotemporal data mining, automated map generalization, data matching of different levels of detail, and other important research topics. Grid patterns are a common pattern type. This paper proposes and implements a method for grid pattern recognition based on the idea of mesh classification through a supervised learning process. To train the classifier, training datasets are selected from worldwide city samples with different cultural, historical, and geographical environments. Meshes are subsequently labeled as composing or noncomposing grids by participants in an experiment, and the mesh measures are defined while accounting for the mesh's individual characteristics and spatial context. The classifier is generated using the C4.5 algorithm. The accuracy of the classifier is evaluated using Kappa statistics and the overall rate of correctness. The average Kappa value is approximately 0.74, which corresponds t...},

abstract = {Abstract The emergence of Cloud Computing technologies brings a new information infrastructure to users. Providing geoprocessing functions in Cloud Computing platforms can bring scalable, on-demand, and cost–effective geoprocessing services to geospatial users. This paper provides a comparative analysis of geoprocessing in Cloud Computing platforms – Microsoft Windows Azure and Google App Engine. The analysis compares differences in the data storage, architecture model, and development environment based on the experience to develop geoprocessing services in the two Cloud Computing platforms; emphasizes the importance of virtualization; recommends applications of hybrid geoprocessing Clouds, and suggests an interoperable solution on geoprocessing Cloud services. The comparison allows one to selectively utilize Cloud Computing platforms or hybrid Cloud pattern, once it is understood that the current development of geoprocessing Cloud services is restricted to specific Cloud Computing platforms with certain kinds of technologies. The performance evaluation is also performed over geoprocessing services deployed in public Cloud platforms. The tested services are developed using geoprocessing algorithms from different vendors, GeoSurf and Java Topology Suite. The evaluation results provide a valuable reference on providing elastic and cost-effective geoprocessing Cloud services.},

This has taken place as part of the Government's and Local Government Denmark's basic data programme where also CBR and company data has become open. The release of geodata and company data is taking place in continuation of other data, e.g. property and address data, being released earlier and made open on the public information server. In continuation of the basic data programme on e.g. geodata, an agreement on maintenance of data and distribution of data has been made accordingly. The release of geodata, among other things, comprises the Danish Geodata Agency's topographic maps, the Danish Elevation Model and the cadastral maps as well as the common public geographic administrative framework, the so-called FOT data, which have been developed and produced by the Danish Geodata Agency and the municipalities in concert since 2006. The release of public basic data is an international trend. With the release, Denmark is one of the countries in the world that has taken the biggest step in making data open.},

abstract = {The efficient sharing of files across distributed enterprises over the wide area network (WAN) has become a Herculean task. The problem is that although gigabytes of data can easily be shared over a local area network (LAN) using standard file server technology, they cannot so easily be shared across remote offices connected over the WAN. Recently, however, a new class of product known as wide-area file services (WAFS) has showed remarkable results in solving the problem of remote office collaboration for distributed organizations. WAFS allows companies with remote offices to utilize the WAN to share files as if it were a virtual LAN, enabling real-time, read/write access to shared files while also guaranteeing the consistency and coherency of all file data. The most successful WAFS systems address inherent WAN file sharing issues through a multi-layered technology approach. In designing this technology, WAFS vendors begin by carefully looking at the file sharing protocols used in today's enterprise infrastructures. This is a key starting point, which bears a closer look.},

Mohamed.El-Mekawy@fpx.se Abstract GeoTest is a project initiated by Future Position X (a GIS cluster organization in G{\"{a}}vle, Sweden), the National Land Survey of Sweden (NLS) and the University of G{\"{a}}vle. The project aims to test Swedish geodata and make sure they comply with the INSPIRE specifications in Annex I–III. The purpose of this paper is to present the development of and experiences from GeoTest in developing the required infrastructure for testing Swedish geodata. Due to the high demand for geodata in modern society, and anticipated requirements by INSPIRE, the issue of testing a national SDI is very important. An adequate testing environment is required. In this context, two aspects are discussed: 1. Technical requirements for GeoTest. 2. Organizational and coordination aspects. The technical requirements for GeoTest are to provide an environment to test current specifications in the context of INSPIRE Annex I. The methodology is crucial to govern the testing process. The developed methodology mainly relates to the transformation testing of the themes specified in Annex I–III. The objective of the tests is to ensure that the specifications are balanced in terms of costs and that they contribute to address user needs. At this stage, GeoTest focuses on transformation testing. The aim is to test that the transformations from local schemas to INSPIRE schemas are technically feasible. The methodology is based on four stages; the main strategy used in this testing was the ETL (extract-transform-load) approach. The testing process started with a preliminary desk study, with the objective to collect basic information about the themes and identify the availability and sources of schemas. The extraction process helped to identify the costly procedures when generating GML data that conform to the source schemas; in this stage we encountered some problems in the extraction process, as the data are loosely coupled to the source schema. The transformation procedures of the GML data from the extraction process to the INSPIRE GML schema performed in three sub-stages, mainly related to schema mapping, matching and transformation. The testing process was coordinated with NLS, via one contact person per theme. The extraction for the sample data was based on random selection of 5{\%} of the sheet index. The paper presents the results of testing five themes addresses, cadastral parcels, geographical names, hydrography, and transport networks. The result shows that in total, 13 INSPIRE schemas has been investigated. Of these, data may be delivered for 10 schemas.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTPattern recognition in road networks can be used for different applications, including spatiotemporal data mining, automated map generalization, data matching of different levels of detail, and other important research topics. Grid patterns are a common pattern type. This paper proposes and implements a method for grid pattern recognition based on the idea of mesh classification through a supervised learning process. To train the classifier, training datasets are selected from worldwide city samples with different cultural, historical, and geographical environments. Meshes are subsequently labeled as composing or noncomposing grids by participants in an experiment, and the mesh measures are defined while accounting for the mesh's individual characteristics and spatial context. The classifier is generated using the C4.5 algorithm. The accuracy of the classifier is evaluated using Kappa statistics and the overall rate of correctness. The average Kappa value is approximately 0.74, which corresponds t...},

abstract = {Seventeen years after its initial publication at ICSE 2000, the Repre-sentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style continues to hold significance as both a guide for understanding how the World Wide Web is designed to work and an example of how principled design, through the application of architectural styles, can impact the development and understanding of large-scale software archi-tecture. However, REST has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using HTTP, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework. In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of REST, as well as several related architectural styles that it in-spired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California's Institute for Software Research at UC Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of REST to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environ-ment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work.},

The paper identifies a candidate set of minimal storage system building blocks, which are sufficiently simple to avoid encapsulating policy where it cannot be customised by applications, and composable to build highly flexible storage architectures. Four main generic components are defined: the store, the namer, the caster and the interpreter. It is hypothesised that these are sufficiently general that they could act as building blocks for any information storage and retrieval system. The essential characteristics of each are defined by an interface, which may be implemented by multiple implementing classes.},

abstract = {Management summary In recent years, interest in releasing public-sector data has grown significantly all over the world. Denmark belongs to the group of countries in which the public sector has systematically worked to make public-sector data available. In the new Digital Strategy for 2016-2010, additional focus is given to the potential of public-sector data to support efficiency improvement and drive financial growth and the identification of new business opportunities. The Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency is responsible for the implementation of four initiatives under the primary objective of the strategy to ensure that public digitisation provides optimal growth conditions. This analysis addresses the aforementioned agenda and has been undertaken with a view to discussing the value-generative role of geodata in the public and private sector, including in the utilities sector. In 2012, the Danish government and KL set up the basic data programme 1 as part of the common public digitisation strategy for 2011-2015. The objective of the programme is to contribute to efficiency improvement, modernisation and improved administration practice in the public sector as well as increased productivity in the private sector. As part of the programme, a large proportion of the data of the then Agency were made publicly available on 1 January 2013. These data are referred to as the open geodata. The release of public geodata was made in anticipation of this having a positive effect on the economy in the form of increased growth rates and a more efficient task execution in the public sector. The decision to make geodata publicly available was thus based on a positive business case according to which the release would create significant benefits for private enterprises as these enterprises would be able to retrieve public basic data of a high quality following the release. In the business case, a savings potential for public authorities was furthermore indicated in the form of a reduction in e.g. costs for the updating and maintenance of own geodata.},

These APIs (Application Program Interfaces) enable registration, management and reporting systems to tightly integrate with Questionmark Perception.

QMWISe is complementary to Perception Integration Protocol (PIP), which remains fully supported as a way of calling Perception assessments. Using QMWISe is the recommended way to interface with Perception, rather than reading and writing directly to the Perception databases. A developer application makes calls to QMWISe using SOAP and web services via HTTP (which is a platform independent transfer mechanism), gets information from the Perception databases, and makes request to add, change or delete information.

QMWISe sends and receives XML data packaged with SOAP. The application calling QMWISe can run under Windows, UNIX or other platforms, and the QMWISe API is entirely platform and programming language independent. The preview release of QMWISe supports 37 separate web service methods and is expected to support IMS data formats in the future.},

abstract = {The strong reliance of most utility services on centralised network infrastructures is becoming increasingly challenged by new technological advances in decentralised alternatives. However, not enough effort has been made to develop planning tools designed to address the implications of these new opportunities and to determine the optimal degree of centralisation of these infrastructures. We introduce a planning tool for sustainable network infrastructure planning (SNIP), a two-step techno-economic heuristic modelling approach based on shortest path-finding and hierarchical-agglomerative clustering algorithms to determine the optimal degree of centralisation in the field of wastewater management. This SNIP model optimises the distribution of wastewater treatment plants and the sewer network outlay relative to several cost and sewer-design parameters. Moreover, it allows us to construct alternative optimal wastewater system designs taking into account topography, economies of scale as well as the full size range of wastewater treatment plants. We quantify and confirm that the optimal degree of centralisation decreases with increasing terrain complexity and settlement dispersion while showing that the effect of the latter exceeds that of topography. Case study results for a Swiss community indicate that the calculated optimal degree of centralisation is substantially lower than the current level.},

abstract = {The development of geographic information systems (GIS) is now being accompanied by an increasing popularity of Internet GIS mapping services. This study concerns two important issues with Internet GIS interoperability and Open source resources. Centering on the interplay of these two issues, we provide a systematic overview of techniques that have been used to deliver Internet GIS mapping and the relevance of the two issues with regard to these techniques. We then present a standard-and-open-source-based framework for Internet GIS mapping services to achieve data interoperability and high visual quality. The framework employs the Web Feature Service (WFS) to handle vector data and raster data. The Geography Markup Language (GML) standard is used for interoperable data storage and management. The Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) standard is used to visualize GML data in web browsers. Two preliminary prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the framework. We conclude that using standard-based solutions is an important and viable direction of interoperable Internet GIS services. Advances in standardization and technology have significant implications for Internet GIS mapping. There are many powerful open sources tools which, when coupled with open standards, may be used to develop high-quality online GIS services. Importantly, these solutions require no investment in software, yet achieve excellent interoperability and visualization quality; they are excellent alternative approaches to Internet mapping.

abstract = {Current data sharing in the Internet environment is supported using metadata at the file level. This approach has three fundamental shortcomings. First, sharing data from different sources with different semantics, data models, and acquisition methods usually requires data conversion and/or integration like data conflation. This can be tedious and error‐prone. Second, data updated from one source cannot be automatically propagated to other related data or applications. Finally, data sharing at the file level makes it difficult to provide feature‐level data for searching, accessing, and exchanging in real time over the Internet. This paper addresses these three issues by proposing a standards‐based framework for sharing geospatial data in the transportation application domain. The proposed framework uses a standard data model—geospatial data model proposed by the Geospatial One‐Stop initiative to harmonize the semantics and data models without the use of data integration methods.
