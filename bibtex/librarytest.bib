Mohamed.El-Mekawy@fpx.se Abstract GeoTest is a project initiated by Future Position X (a GIS cluster organization in G{\"{a}}vle, Sweden), the National Land Survey of Sweden (NLS) and the University of G{\"{a}}vle. The project aims to test Swedish geodata and make sure they comply with the INSPIRE specifications in Annex I–III. The purpose of this paper is to present the development of and experiences from GeoTest in developing the required infrastructure for testing Swedish geodata. Due to the high demand for geodata in modern society, and anticipated requirements by INSPIRE, the issue of testing a national SDI is very important. An adequate testing environment is required. In this context, two aspects are discussed: 1. Technical requirements for GeoTest. 2. Organizational and coordination aspects. The technical requirements for GeoTest are to provide an environment to test current specifications in the context of INSPIRE Annex I. The methodology is crucial to govern the testing process. The developed methodology mainly relates to the transformation testing of the themes specified in Annex I–III. The objective of the tests is to ensure that the specifications are balanced in terms of costs and that they contribute to address user needs. At this stage, GeoTest focuses on transformation testing. The aim is to test that the transformations from local schemas to INSPIRE schemas are technically feasible. The methodology is based on four stages; the main strategy used in this testing was the ETL (extract-transform-load) approach. The testing process started with a preliminary desk study, with the objective to collect basic information about the themes and identify the availability and sources of schemas. The extraction process helped to identify the costly procedures when generating GML data that conform to the source schemas; in this stage we encountered some problems in the extraction process, as the data are loosely coupled to the source schema. The transformation procedures of the GML data from the extraction process to the INSPIRE GML schema performed in three sub-stages, mainly related to schema mapping, matching and transformation. The testing process was coordinated with NLS, via one contact person per theme. The extraction for the sample data was based on random selection of 5{\%} of the sheet index. The paper presents the results of testing five themes addresses, cadastral parcels, geographical names, hydrography, and transport networks. The result shows that in total, 13 INSPIRE schemas has been investigated. Of these, data may be delivered for 10 schemas.},

abstract = {Abstract The emergence of Cloud Computing technologies brings a new information infrastructure to users. Providing geoprocessing functions in Cloud Computing platforms can bring scalable, on-demand, and cost–effective geoprocessing services to geospatial users. This paper provides a comparative analysis of geoprocessing in Cloud Computing platforms – Microsoft Windows Azure and Google App Engine. The analysis compares differences in the data storage, architecture model, and development environment based on the experience to develop geoprocessing services in the two Cloud Computing platforms; emphasizes the importance of virtualization; recommends applications of hybrid geoprocessing Clouds, and suggests an interoperable solution on geoprocessing Cloud services. The comparison allows one to selectively utilize Cloud Computing platforms or hybrid Cloud pattern, once it is understood that the current development of geoprocessing Cloud services is restricted to specific Cloud Computing platforms with certain kinds of technologies. The performance evaluation is also performed over geoprocessing services deployed in public Cloud platforms. The tested services are developed using geoprocessing algorithms from different vendors, GeoSurf and Java Topology Suite. The evaluation results provide a valuable reference on providing elastic and cost-effective geoprocessing Cloud services.},

abstract = {STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 6, 2002--Testing and assessment software provider Questionmark has taken another step towards making Questionmark(TM) Perception(TM) the de facto standard in testing and assessment software with the release of QMWISe, a comprehensive series of APIs. These APIs (Application Program Interfaces) enable registration, management and reporting systems to tightly integrate with Questionmark Perception.

QMWISe is complementary to Perception Integration Protocol (PIP), which remains fully supported as a way of calling Perception assessments. Using QMWISe is the recommended way to interface with Perception, rather than reading and writing directly to the Perception databases. A developer application makes calls to QMWISe using SOAP and web services via HTTP (which is a platform independent transfer mechanism), gets information from the Perception databases, and makes request to add, change or delete information.

QMWISe sends and receives XML data packaged with SOAP. The application calling QMWISe can run under Windows, UNIX or other platforms, and the QMWISe API is entirely platform and programming language independent. The preview release of QMWISe supports 37 separate web service methods and is expected to support IMS data formats in the future.},

abstract = {We present a generic API suitable for provision of highly generic storage facilities that can be tailored to produce various individually customised storage infrastructures. The paper identifies a candidate set of minimal storage system building blocks, which are sufficiently simple to avoid encapsulating policy where it cannot be customised by applications, and composable to build highly flexible storage architectures. Four main generic components are defined: the store, the namer, the caster and the interpreter. It is hypothesised that these are sufficiently general that they could act as building blocks for any information storage and retrieval system. The essential characteristics of each are defined by an interface, which may be implemented by multiple implementing classes.},
